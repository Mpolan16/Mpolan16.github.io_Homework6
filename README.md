Weather Outside: a 5 day forcast web app

This application was created for users who need a detailed 5 day forcast of any city. The ideal user is a traveler or a user that spends time outdoor. 

To use this app the user can search any city and a 5 day forcast shows. If the user need multiple cities, the previously searched cities will be saved and can be referenced later.

To build this app I used the Bootstrap Framework as well as HTML, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, and Font Awesome. I also used the Current Weather Data, UV Index, and the 5 day / 3 hour forecast APIs from the Open Weather Map API in order to successfuly achieve the project.
